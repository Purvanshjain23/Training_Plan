# Training Repository for Copilot & RooCode Exercises

This repository accompanies the **GitHub Copilot**, **RooCode** and **Prompt Engineering** training plans.  It contains a variety of example files and exercises designed to help you practise AI‑assisted coding.  The focus is on Python and Java, but the concepts apply to any language.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** locally or open it directly in VS Code.
2. Review the training plans for Copilot, RooCode and Prompt Engineering.
3. Work through the exercises in `training_exercises.md` using GitHub Copilot or RooCode.  Write clear prompts based on the guidelines, then review and iterate on the results.
4. Use the prompts in `prompt_library.md` as templates, adjusting them to suit your tasks.
5. For the Java migration example, examine the difference between the `legacy_java` and `modern_java` versions.  Use Copilot’s Agents or RooCode’s Orchestrator Mode to perform the migration yourself.

By completing these exercises you will gain hands‑on experience with AI‑assisted development and learn how to craft effective prompts.
